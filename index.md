<h1 style="color:#FFFFCC"> Healing from the Inside Out </h1>

Inner Journey Healing Arts is a safe and sacred place for adults and children to heal from domestic violence, trauma, and stressful life situations.


Licensed Clinical Social Workers focus on treatment areas such as Family of Origin issues, Grief/Loss, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and similar areas of distress.

We use a variety of holistic therapies to empower clients to heal and recover,
 including expressive arts, counseling, naturopathic medicine, natural remedies,
 _- i.e. vitamin,/amino acid and essential oils that have been researched to help clients recover from chronic pain, anxiety, depression etc. -_ These powerful methods have demonstrated positive results in assisting clients who are struggling with health or emotional issues to integrate mind, body, emotions, and spirit.


We can provide training for counselors, therapists, and health providers. We also host a variety of workshops and gatherings for professionals and the public alike, as you can see from our Events page. So please take a look and see if anything calls you to participate!


We would love for you to join us in building a conscious community of people who want to heal themselves and help heal our part in the World.
