## HOW ART HEALS

_(From "Creative Healing," 1998, pg. 88, by Michael Samuel, M.D., and Mary Rockwood Lane, R.N., M.S.N.)_

* Autonomic nervous system shifts the body to the relaxation response.
* Hormones shift the body to a healing mode.
* Blood flow shifts, bringing in nutrients and immune cells.
* Killer T-cells eat cancer cells.
* Neurotransmitters and endorphins reduce pain.
* Self-healing mechanisms are released.


## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

From May 2000 through December 2005, Inner Journey Healing Arts has worked with over 1000 clients. Sixteen percent of this total were family units. Part of this group was in recovery from substance abuse. All clients maintained sobriety while in treatment.

The families reported less confliction acting out behavior, increased communication among siblings and parents, and more open displays of affection. Family together time increased, with an improved and stronger sense of unity and cooperation within the family unit. Deeper understanding of each member's needs increased. Problem-solving skills also increased, creating more win/win solutions.

> A couple who had a history of acting out behavior stated they "learned to talk more, and act out less while in treatment."

> One client, who tended to relapse on alcohol use every year around the anniversary of her father's death, completed a healing grief ceremony at our center. This was the first year she was able to continuously maintain her sobriety. She was quite happy to find a solution to her alcohol relapses.

> A client who experienced debilitating migraine headaches reported complete relief of her symptoms through the use of expressive art techniques used at our center.

> Another client who has autoimmune disorder began to increase her t-cell counts through creative relaxation techniques and expressive art therapies while in treatment.

> Three families who were involved with Child Protective Services had their children return home because they were progressing well in treatment while at Inner Journey Healing Arts.

Inner Journey Healing Arts gave educational training to professional staff members at St. Luke Rehabilitation Center, Sacred Heart Medical Center, and Cancer Care Northwest in Washington.

Contracted staff out to other treatment centers to conduct expressive therapy groups, which consisted of 8 to 9 process groups a week.
